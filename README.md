# 🛍️ Amazon Review Generator

A C# application designed to generate realistic Amazon-style product reviews for testing, demo, or entertainment purposes.

## 🧠 Architecture & Technology Breakdown

### 🧱 Core Components

| Component                  | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Review Generator**       | Uses a Markov chain model to generate realistic-sounding review text        |
| **Training Data**          | Seeded with sample reviews to build the Markov transition matrix            |
| **API Layer (optional)**   | Can expose the generator via a REST endpoint (e.g., using ASP.NET Core)     |
| **Unit Tests**             | Validate the generator’s output and logic correctness                      |

### 🔄 How Markov Chains Work in This Project

Markov chains are a **probabilistic model** that generates text by predicting the next word based only on the current word (or short sequence of words), not the entire history. This is known as the **Markov property** — memorylessness.

#### 🧩 Process Overview

1. **Training Phase**:
   - The generator analyzes a corpus of sample reviews.
   - It builds a **transition matrix** mapping word pairs (or triplets) to likely next words.

2. **Generation Phase**:
   - Starts with a seed word or phrase.
   - Uses the transition matrix to probabilistically select the next word.
   - Repeats until a full review is formed.

#### 📌 Example

If the training data includes:
> "This product is amazing. This product is durable."

Then the Markov chain might learn:
- `"This"` → `"product"` (100%)
- `"product"` → `"is"` (100%)
- `"is"` → `"amazing"` (50%), `"durable"` (50%)

So a generated review might be:
> "This product is durable."

|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **C# (.NET)**     | Core application logic                            |
| **Markov Chain Algorithm** | Text generation engine based on word transitions |
| **xUnit / MSTest**| Unit testing framework                            |

### 📈 Extensibility Ideas

- Add **n-gram support** to improve coherence (e.g., using 2-word or 3-word states).
- Integrate a **sentiment classifier** to control tone (positive, neutral, negative).
- Expose via **REST API** for use in other apps or testing pipelines.
- Add **CSV export** for bulk review generation.
